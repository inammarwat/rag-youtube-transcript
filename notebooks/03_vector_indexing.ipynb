    "# Notebook 03 – Embedding & Vector Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this notebook is to convert preprocessed transcript chunks into vector embeddings and construct a searchable vector index for semantic retrieval.  \n",
    "This stage forms the core knowledge base of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input\n",
    "\n",
    "- List of cleaned and chunked transcript segments (from Notebook 02)\n",
    "- Embedding model (Google Gemini or compatible embedding provider)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vector embeddings for all transcript chunks\n",
    "- FAISS vector store containing indexed embeddings\n",
    "- Retriever object capable of performing semantic similarity search\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load chunked transcript data.\n",
    "2. Initialize embedding model.\n",
    "3. Generate embeddings for each chunk.\n",
    "4. Build a FAISS vector index.\n",
    "5. Configure retriever with top-k similarity search.\n",
    "6. Test retrieval using a sample query.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why This Step is Important\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot efficiently process long documents directly due to context window limitations.  \n",
    "By converting text chunks into dense vector representations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Semantic similarity search becomes possible.\n",
    "- Relevant context can be retrieved dynamically.\n",
    "- Hallucination risk is reduced.\n",
    "- Response quality improves through grounded context injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook completes the **knowledge indexing stage** of the RAG architecture and prepares the system for generative response integration in Notebook 04.\n"
